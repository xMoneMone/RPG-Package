# WORK IN PROGRESS

A PyGame package for making mainly highly customisable top-down RPGs, but can also be used for visual novels and point-and-click games (but are still clanky at the moment). It handles room building, collision detection, movement and animation, dialogue rendering, cutscenes, and more. A user guide will be written once the package is complete.
